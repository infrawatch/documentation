= Metrics retention time period in {Project}

[role="_abstract"]
The default retention time for metrics stored in {Project} ({ProjectShort}) is 24 hours, which provides enough data for trends to develop for the purposes of alerting.

For long-term storage, use systems designed for long-term data retention, for example, Thanos.
