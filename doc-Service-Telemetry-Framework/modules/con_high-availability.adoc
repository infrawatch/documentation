// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_high-availability.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.
[id="high-availability_{context}"]
= High availability
High availability is the ability of {Project} ({ProjectShort}) to rapidly recover from failures in its component services. Although {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort}) restarts a failed pod if nodes are available to schedule the workload, this recovery process might take more than one minute, during which time events and metrics are lost. A high availability configuration includes multiple copies of {ProjectShort} components, reducing recovery time to approximately 2 seconds. To protect against failure of an {OpenShiftShort} node, deploy {ProjectShort} to an {OpenShiftShort} cluster with three or more nodes.

[NOTE]
{ProjectShort} is not yet a fully fault tolerant system. Delivery of metrics and events during the recovery period is not guaranteed.

Enabling high availability has the following effects:

* Three ElasticSearch pods run instead of the default one.
* The following components run two pods instead of the default one:
** {MessageBus}
** Alertmanager
** Prometheus
** Events Smart Gateway
** Collectd Metrics Smart Gateway
* Recovery time from a lost pod in any of these services reduces to approximately 2 seconds.

[NOTE]
The Ceilometer Metrics Smart Gateway is not yet HA
