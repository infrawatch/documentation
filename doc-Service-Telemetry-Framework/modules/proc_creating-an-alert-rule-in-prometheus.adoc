= Creating an alert rule in Prometheus

Prometheus evaluates alert rules to trigger notifications. If the rule condition returns an empty result set, the condition is false. Otherwise, the rule is true and it triggers an alert.

== Procedure

. Create a `PrometheusRule` object that contains the alert rule. The Prometheus Operator loads the rule into Prometheus:
+
----
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    prometheus: stf-default
    role: alert-rules
  name: prometheus-alarm-rules
  namespace: service-telemetry
spec:
  groups:
    - name: ./openstack.rules
      rules:
        - alert: Metric Listener down
          expr: collectd_qpid_router_status < 1 # To change the rule, edit the value of the expr parameter.
EOF
----

. To verify that the rules have been loaded into Prometheus by the Operator, create a pod with access to `curl`:
+
----
oc run curl --generator=run-pod/v1 --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty
----

. Run `curl` to access the `prometheus-operated` service to return the rules loaded into memory:
+
----
[ root@curl:/ ]$ curl prometheus-operated:9090/api/v1/rules
{"status":"success","data":{"groups":[{"name":"./openstack.rules","file":"/etc/prometheus/rules/prometheus-stf-default-rulefiles-0/service-telemetry-prometheus-alarm-rules.yaml","rules":[{"name":"Metric Listener down","query":"collectd_qpid_router_status \u003c 1","duration":0,"labels":{},"annotations":{},"alerts":[],"health":"ok","type":"alerting"}],"interval":30}]}}
----

. To verify that the output shows the rules loaded into the `PrometheusRule` object, for example the output contains the defined `./openstack.rules`, exit from the pod:
+
----
[ root@curl:/ ]$ exit
----

. Clean up the environment by deleting the `curl` pod:
+
----
$ oc delete pod curl

pod "curl" deleted
----
