// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_configuring-ephemeral-storage.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

To configure {ProjectShort} for ephemeral storage, you must add the `storageEphemeralEnabled: true` parameter to the ServiceTelemetry object in {OpenShiftShort}. You can this set this parameter at installation time or, if you already deployed {ProjectShort}, complete the following steps:

. Use the oc command to edit the ServiceTelemetry object:
+
----
    oc edit ServiceTelemetry
----

. Add the `storageEphemeralEnabled: true` parameter to the `spec` section:
+
----
spec:
  eventsEnabled: true
  metricsEnabled: true
  storageEphemeralEnabled: true
----

. Save your changes and close the object.
