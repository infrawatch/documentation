= Configuring multiple clouds

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure multiple {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) clouds to target a single instance of {Project} ({ProjectShort}). When you configure multiple clouds, every cloud must send metrics and events on their own unique message bus topic. In the {ProjectShort} deployment, Smart Gateway instances listen on these topics to save information to the common data store. Data that is stored by the Smart Gateway in the data storage domain is filtered by using the metadata that each of Smart Gateways creates.

[WARNING]
====
Be sure that every cloud deployment has a unique cloud domain configuration. For more information about configuring the domain for your cloud deployment, see xref:setting-a-unique-cloud-domain_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].

To configure the {OpenStackShort} overcloud for a multiple cloud scenario, complete the following tasks:

. Plan the AMQP address prefixes that you want to use for each cloud. For more information, see xref:planning-amqp-address-prefixes_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
. Deploy metrics and events consumer Smart Gateways for each cloud to listen on the corresponding address prefixes. For more information, see xref:deploying-smart-gateways_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
. Configure each cloud with a unique domain name. For more information, see xref:setting-a-unique-cloud-domain_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
. Create the base configuration for {ProjectShort}. For more information, see xref:creating-the-base-configuration-for-stf_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
. Configure each cloud to send its metrics and events to {ProjectShort} on the correct address. For more information, see xref:creating-openstack-environment-file-for-multiple-clouds_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
