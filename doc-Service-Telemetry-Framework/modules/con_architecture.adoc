// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>
:appendix-caption: Appendix
// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_architecture.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= {ProjectShort} architecture

{ProjectShort} uses the following components:

* collectd to collect metrics
* Prometheus as time-series data storage
* ElasticSearch as events data storage
* An AMQP 1.x compatible messaging bus to shuttle the metrics to {ProjectShort} for storage in Prometheus
* Smart Gateway to pick metrics and events from the AMQP 1.x bus and to deliver them to ElasticSearch or to provide them to Prometheus

The following diagram is an overview of {ProjectShort} architecture:

On the client side, collectd collects high-resolution metrics. collectd delivers the data to Prometheus by using the AMQP1 plugin, which places the data onto the
message bus. On the server side, a Golang application called the Smart Gateway
takes the data stream from the bus and exposes it as a local scrape endpoint
for Prometheus.

Server-side {ProjectShort} monitoring infrastructure consists of the following
layers:

* {Project} 1.x ({ProjectShort})
* {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort})
* Infrastructure platform

NOTE:
Do not install {OpenShift} on the same infrastructure that you want to monitor.
