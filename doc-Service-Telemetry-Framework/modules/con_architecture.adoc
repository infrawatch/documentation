// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>
:appendix-caption: Appendix
// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_architecture.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

[NOTE]
The {Project} data collection components, collectd and Ceilometer, and the transport components, {MessageBus} and Smart Gateway, are fully supported. The data storage components, Prometheus and ElasticSearch, including the Operator artifacts, and visualization component Grafana are community-supported, and are not officially supported.

For metrics, on the client side, collectd collects high-resolution metrics related to the underlying infrastructure, and Ceilometer provides platform-level metrics for {OpenStack}. Both Ceilometer and collectd deliver data to Prometheus by using the {MessageBus} transport, delivering the data via the message bus. On the server side, a Golang application called the Smart Gateway takes the data stream from the bus and exposes it as a local scrape endpoint for Prometheus.

If you plan to collect and store events, collectd or Ceilometer delivers event data to the server side by using the {MessageBus} transport, delivering the data through the message bus. Another Smart Gateway writes the data to the ElasticSearch datastore.

Server-side {ProjectShort} monitoring infrastructure consists of the following layers:

* {Project} 1.x ({ProjectShort})
* {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort})
* Infrastructure platform
