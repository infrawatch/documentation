[id="stf-architecture_{context}"]
= {Project} architecture

[role="_abstract"]
{Project} ({ProjectShort}) uses a client-server architecture, in which {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) is the client and {OpenShift} is the server.

{ProjectShort} is capable of dealing with both metrics and events information from {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) but the default installation is focused on collection, transport, and storage of metrics information.

Event data can be enabled on {OpenStack}, transported via the message bus, and then forwarded to a user-provided Elasticsearch from the Smart Gateways, but this architecture is deprecated. The discussion in this guide will be focused on the default deployment configuration.
// For more information about {ProjectShort} when configured with events, see <xref-TODO>. Tracked via https://issues.redhat.com/browse/STF-1552

{ProjectShort} consists of the following components:

* Data collection
** collectd: Collects infrastructure metrics and events on {OpenStackShort}.
** Ceilometer: Collects {OpenStackShort} metrics and events on {OpenStackShort}.
* Transport
** {MessageBus}: An AMQP 1.x compatible messaging bus that provides fast and reliable data transport to transfer the metrics from {OpenStackShort} to {ProjectShort} for storage or forwarding.
** Smart Gateway: A Golang application that takes metrics and events from the AMQP 1.x bus to deliver to Prometheus or an external Elasticsearch.
* Data storage
** Prometheus: Time-series data storage that stores {ProjectShort} metrics received from the Smart Gateway.
** Alertmanager: An alerting tool that uses Prometheus alert rules to manage alerts.
* User provided components
** Grafana: A visualization and analytics application that you can use to query, visualize, and explore data.
** Elasticsearch: Events data storage that stores {OpenStackShort} events received and forwarded by the Smart Gateway.

The following table describes the application of the client and server components:

[IMPORTANT]
To ensure that the monitoring platform can report operational problems with your cloud, do not install {ProjectShort} on the same infrastructure that you are monitoring.

For client side metrics, collectd provides infrastructure metrics without project data, and Ceilometer provides {OpenStackShort} platform data based on projects or user workload. Both Ceilometer and collectd deliver data to Prometheus by using the {MessageBus} transport, delivering the data through the message bus. On the server side, a Golang application called the Smart Gateway takes the data stream from the bus and exposes it as a local scrape endpoint for Prometheus.

When you collect and store events, collectd and Ceilometer deliver event data to the server side by using the {MessageBus} transport. Another Smart Gateway forwards the data to a user-provided Elasticsearch datastore.

[NOTE]
====
In previous releases of {ProjectShort}, the Service Telemetry Operator would request instances of Elasticsearch from the Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) Operator. {ProjectShort} now uses a forwarding model where events are forwarded from a Smart Gateway instance to a user-provided instance of Elasticsearch. The management of an Elasticsearch instance by Service Telemetry Operator is deprecated.

New ServiceTelemetry instances will use the `observabilityStrategy` of `use_redhat` which does not request Elasticsearch instances from ECK. Instances of ServiceTelemetry deployed prior to {ProjectShort} 1.5.3 use an observabilityStrategy of use_community, which matches the previous architecture. In the case where a user previously deployed an Elasticsearch instance with {ProjectShort},  the Service Telemetry Operator will automatically update the ServiceTelemetry custom resource object to have the observabilityStrategy set to use_community, and remain functioning the same as previous releases. For more information about observability strategies, see xref:observability-strategy-in-service-telemetry-framework_assembly-preparing-your-ocp-environment-for-stf[].

A user can migrate to the use_redhat observability strategy. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7011708[Migrating Service Telemetry Framework to fully supported operators].

Server-side {ProjectShort} monitoring infrastructure consists of the following layers:

* {Project} {ProductVersion}
ifeval::["{SupportedOpenShiftVersion}" == "{NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}"]
* {OpenShift} {SupportedOpenShiftVersion}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{SupportedOpenShiftVersion}" != "{NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}"]
* {OpenShift} {SupportedOpenShiftVersion} through {NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}
endif::[]
* Infrastructure platform
