[NOTE]
The {Project} data collection components, collectd and Ceilometer, and the transport components, {MessageBus} and Smart Gateway, are fully supported. The data storage components, Prometheus and ElasticSearch, including the Operator artifacts, and visualization component Grafana are community-supported, and are not officially supported.

For metrics, on the client side, collectd provides infrastructure metrics (without project data), and Ceilometer provides {OpenStack} platform data based on projects or user workload. Both Ceilometer and collectd deliver data to Prometheus by using the {MessageBus} transport, delivering the data through the message bus. On the server side, a Golang application called the Smart Gateway takes the data stream from the bus and exposes it as a local scrape endpoint for Prometheus.

If you plan to collect and store events, collectd or Ceilometer delivers event data to the server side by using the {MessageBus} transport, delivering the data through the message bus. Another Smart Gateway writes the data to the ElasticSearch datastore.

Server-side {ProjectShort} monitoring infrastructure consists of the following layers:

* {Project} {ProductVersion} ({ProjectShort})
* {OpenShift} {SupportedOpenShiftVersion} ({OpenShiftShort})
* Infrastructure platform

[NOTE]
Do not install {OpenShiftShort} on the same infrastructure that you want to monitor.
