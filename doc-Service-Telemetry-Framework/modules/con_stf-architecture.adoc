[id="stf-architecture_{context}"]
= {Project} architecture

[role="_abstract"]
{Project} ({ProjectShort}) uses a client-server architecture, in which {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) is the client and {OpenShift} is the server.

{ProjectShort} consists of the following components:


* Data collection
** collectd: Collects infrastructure metrics and events.
** Ceilometer: Collects {OpenStackShort} metrics and events.
* Transport
** {MessageBus}: An AMQP 1.x compatible messaging bus that provides fast and reliable data transport to transfer the metrics to {ProjectShort} for storage.
** Smart Gateway: A Golang application that takes metrics and events from the AMQP 1.x bus to deliver to Prometheus or an external Elasticsearch.
* Data storage
** Prometheus: Time-series data storage that stores {ProjectShort} metrics received from the Smart Gateway.
** Alertmanager: An alerting tool that uses Prometheus alert rules to manage alerts.
** Grafana: A visualization and analytics application that you can use to query, visualize, and explore data.

The following table describes the application of the client and server components:

[IMPORTANT]
To ensure that the monitoring platform can report operational problems with your cloud, do not install {ProjectShort} on the same infrastructure that you are monitoring.

For client side metrics, collectd provides infrastructure metrics without project data, and Ceilometer provides {OpenStackShort} platform data based on projects or user workload. Both Ceilometer and collectd deliver data to Prometheus by using the {MessageBus} transport, delivering the data through the message bus. On the server side, a Golang application called the Smart Gateway takes the data stream from the bus and exposes it as a local scrape endpoint for Prometheus.

If you plan to collect and store events, collectd and Ceilometer deliver event data to the server side by using the {MessageBus} transport. Another Smart Gateway writes the data to the Elasticsearch datastore.

Server-side {ProjectShort} monitoring infrastructure consists of the following layers:

* {Project} {ProductVersion}
ifeval::["{SupportedOpenShiftVersion}" == "{NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}"]
* {OpenShift} {SupportedOpenShiftVersion}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{SupportedOpenShiftVersion}" != "{NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}"]
* {OpenShift} {SupportedOpenShiftVersion} through {NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}
endif::[]
* Infrastructure platform
