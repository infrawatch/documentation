|yes

|Smart Gateway to pick metrics and events from the AMQP 1.x bus and to deliver events to ElasticSearch or to provide metrics to Prometheus
|no
|yes

|Prometheus as time-series data storage

[IMPORTANT]
To ensure that the monitoring platform can report operational problems with your cloud, do not install {ProjectShort} on the same infrastructure that you are monitoring.

For client side metrics, collectd provides infrastructure metrics without project data, and Ceilometer provides {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) platform data based on projects or user workload. Both Ceilometer and collectd deliver data to Prometheus by using the {MessageBus} transport, delivering the data through the message bus. On the server side, a Golang application called the Smart Gateway takes the data stream from the bus and exposes it as a local scrape endpoint for Prometheus.

If you plan to collect and store events, collectd and Ceilometer delivers event data to the server side by using the {MessageBus} transport. Another Smart Gateway writes the data to the ElasticSearch datastore.

Server-side {ProjectShort} monitoring infrastructure consists of the following layers:

* {Project} {ProductVersion}
* {OpenShift} {SupportedOpenShiftVersion} or {NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}
* Infrastructure platform
