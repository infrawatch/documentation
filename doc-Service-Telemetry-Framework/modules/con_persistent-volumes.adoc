// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_persistent-volumes.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

[role="_abstract"]
{ProjectShort} uses persistent storage in {OpenShift} to instantiate the volumes dynamically so that Prometheus and ElasticSearch can store metrics and events.

When persistent storage is enabled through the Service Telemetry Operator, the Persistent Volume Claims requested in an {ProjectShort} deployment results in an access mode of RWO (ReadWriteOnce). If your environment contains pre-provisioned persistent volumes, ensure that volumes of RWO are available in the {OpenShift} default configured `storageClass`.
