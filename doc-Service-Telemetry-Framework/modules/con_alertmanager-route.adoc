Use Alertmanager to deliver alerts to an external system, such as email, IRC, or other notification channel. The Prometheus Operator manages the Alertmanager configuration as a {OpenShift} secret. By default, {Project} ({ProjectShort}) deploys a basic configuration that results in no receivers:

[source,yaml]
----
alertmanager.yaml: |-
  global:
    resolve_timeout: 5m
  route:
    group_by: ['job']
    group_wait: 30s
    group_interval: 5m
    repeat_interval: 12h
    receiver: 'null'
  receivers:
