// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_sizing-your-installation.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Installation size of {OpenShift}

[role="_abstract"]
The size of your {OpenShift} installation depends on the following factors:

* The number of nodes you want to monitor.
* The number of metrics you want to collect.
* The resolution of metrics.
* The length of time that you want to store the data.

Installation of {Project} ({ProjectShort}) depends on the existing {OpenShift} environment. Ensure that you install monitoring for {OpenStack} on a platform separate from your {OpenStack} environment. You can install {OpenShift} on baremetal or other supported cloud platforms. For more information about installing {OpenShift}, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{SupportedOpenShiftVersion}/welcome/index.html#cluster-installer-activities[OpenShift Container Platform {SupportedOpenShiftVersion} Documentation].

The size of your {OpenShift} environment depends on the infrastructure you select. For more information about minimum resources requirements when installing {OpenShift} on baremetal, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{SupportedOpenShiftVersion}/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#minimum-resource-requirements_installing-bare-metal[Minimum resource requirements] in the _Installing a cluster on bare metal_ guide. For installation requirements of the various public and private cloud platforms which you can install, see the corresponding installation documentation for your cloud platform of choice.
