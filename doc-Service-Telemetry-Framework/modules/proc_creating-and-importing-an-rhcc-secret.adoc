// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_creating-and-importing-an-rhcc-secret.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Creating and importing an RHCC Secret

Import the applicable container images from the Red Hat Container Catalog (RHCC). For more information about getting started with the RHCC, see link:https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/started[Red Hat Container Catalog Get Started Guide].

To import the applicable container images from the RHCC, complete the following steps:

. Create a registry service account. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/[Registry Service Accounts].

. Create a manifest that you can load into OpenShift. This instantiates a Secret resource to use for importing the container images from RHCC. Create the following sample manifest for your registry service account in the `sa-telemetry` namespace previously created:

    ----
    apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: serviceassurance-pull-secret
    data:
      .dockerconfigjson: <provided_token>
    type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
    ----

. Use the oc tool to create the Secret resource:

    ----
    oc create -f serviceassurance-secret.yaml
    ----
