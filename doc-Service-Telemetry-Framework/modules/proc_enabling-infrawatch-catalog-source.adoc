// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing

//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also

= Enabling InfraWatch Catalog Source

[role="_abstract"]
Before you deploy {ProjectShort} on {OpenShift}, you must enable the catalog source.

.Procedure

. Install a CatalogSource that contains the Service Telemetry Operator and the Smart Gateway Operator:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: infrawatch-operators
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  displayName: InfraWatch Operators
  image: quay.io/infrawatch-operators/infrawatch-catalog:nightly
  publisher: InfraWatch
  sourceType: grpc
  updateStrategy:
    registryPoll:
      interval: 30m
EOF
----

. Validate the creation of your CatalogSource:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get -nopenshift-marketplace catalogsource infrawatch-operators

NAME                   DISPLAY                TYPE   PUBLISHER    AGE
infrawatch-operators   InfraWatch Operators   grpc   InfraWatch   2m16s
----



. Validate that the Operators are available from the catalog:
+

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get packagemanifests | grep InfraWatch

service-telemetry-operator                    InfraWatch Operators       7m20s
smart-gateway-operator                        InfraWatch Operators       7m20s
