// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_manifest-overrides.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

[role="_abstract"]
The Service Telemetry Operator watches for a `ServiceTelemetry` manifest to load into {OpenShift}. The Operator then creates other objects in memory, which results in the dependent Operators creating the workloads they are responsible for managing.

[WARNING]
====
When you override the manifest, you must provide the entire manifest contents, including object names or namespaces. There is no dynamic parameter substitution when you override a manifest.

Use manifest overrides only as a last resort short circuit.
====

To override a manifest successfully with {Project} ({ProjectShort}), deploy a default environment using the core options only. For more information about the core options, see xref:creating-a-servicetelemetry-object-in-openshift_assembly-installing-the-core-components-of-stf[]. When you deploy {ProjectShort}, use the `oc get` command to retrieve the default deployed manifest. When you use a manifest that was originally generated by Service Telemetry Operator, the manifest is compatible with the other objects that are managed by the Operators.

For example, when the `backends.metrics.prometheus.enabled: true` parameter is configured in the `ServiceTelemetry` manifest, the Service Telemetry Operator requests components for metrics retrieval and storage using the default manifests. In some cases, you might want to override the default manifest. For more information, see xref:manifest-override-parameters_assembly-advanced-features[].
