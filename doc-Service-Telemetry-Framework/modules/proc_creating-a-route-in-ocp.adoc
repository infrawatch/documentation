// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_exposing-routes.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Creating a route in {OpenShift}

[role="_abstract"]
In {OpenShift}, you can expose applications to the external network via a route. For more information, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{SupportedOpenShiftVersion}/networking/configuring_ingress_cluster_traffic/overview-traffic.html[Configuring ingress cluster traffic].

In {Project} ({ProjectShort}), routes are not exposed by default  to limit the attack surface of {ProjectShort} deployments. To access some services deployed in {ProjectShort}, you must expose the services in {OpenShiftShort} for access.

A common service to expose in {ProjectShort} is Prometheus, as shown in the following example:

.Procedure

. Log in to {OpenShift}.
. Change to the `service-telemetry` namespace:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc project service-telemetry
----

. List the available services in the `service-telemetry` project:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get services
----
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]

. Take note of the port and service name to expose as a route, for example, service `prometheus-operated` and port `9090`.

. Expose the `prometheus-operated` service as an edge route and redirect insecure traffic to the secure endpoint of port `9090`:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc create route edge metrics-store --service=prometheus-operated --insecure-policy="Redirect" --port=9090
----
+
----
route.route.openshift.io/metrics-store created
----

. To verify and find the exposed external DNS for the route, use the `oc get route` command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get route metrics-store -ogo-template='{{.spec.host}}'
----
+
----
metrics-store-service-telemetry.apps.infra.watch
----

+
The `prometheus-operated` service is now available at the exposed DNS address, for example, https://metrics-store-service-telemetry.apps.infra.watch
+
[NOTE]
The address of the route must be resolvable and configuration is environment specific.
