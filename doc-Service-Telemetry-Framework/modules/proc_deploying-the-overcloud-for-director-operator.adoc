= Deploying the overcloud for director Operator

Deploy or update the overcloud with the required environment files so that data is collected and transmitted to {Project} ({ProjectShort}).

.Procedure

. Log in to the {OpenShift} environment where {OpenStackShort} director Operator is deployed and change to the project that hosts your {OpenStackShort} deployment:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc project openstack
----

. Open the `OpenStackConfigGenerator` custom resource for editing:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="verbatim"]
----
$ oc edit OpenStackConfigGenerator
----

. Add the `metrics/ceilometer-write-qdr.yaml` and `metrics/qdr-edge-only.yaml` environment files as values for the `heatEnvs` parameter. Save your edits, and close the `OpenStackConfigGenerator` custom resource:
[NOTE]
If you already deployed a {OpenStack} environment using director Operator, you must delete the existing `OpenStackConfigGenerator` and create a new object with the full configuration in order to re-generate the `OpenStackConfigVersion`.

.OpenStackConfigGenerator

  heatEnvs:

  - metrics/ceilometer-write-qdr.yaml
  - metrics/qdr-edge-only.yaml
----

. If you already deployed a {OpenStack} environment using director Operator and generated a new `OpenStackConfigVersion`, edit the `OpenStackDeploy` object of your deployment, and set the value of `spec.configVersion` to the new `OpenStackConfigVersion` in order to update the overcloud deployment.
