// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_setting-up-the-dashboard-to-host-grafana.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Configuring SNMP Traps

[role="_abstract"]
You can integrate {Project} ({ProjectShort}) with an existing infrastructure monitoring platform that receives notifications via SNMP traps. To enable SNMP traps, modify the `ServiceTelemetry` object and configure the `snmpTraps` parameters.

For more information about configuring alerts, see xref:alerts_assembly-advanced-features[].

.Prerequisites

* Know the IP address or hostname of the SNMP trap receiver where you want to send the alerts

.Procedure

. To enable SNMP traps, modify the `ServiceTelemetry` object:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc edit stf default
----
. Set the `alerting.alertmanager.receivers.snmpTraps` parameters:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: infra.watch/v1beta1
kind: ServiceTelemetry
...
spec:
  ...
  alerting:
    alertmanager:
      receivers:
        snmpTraps:
          enabled: true
          target: 10.10.10.10
----

. Ensure that you set the value of `target` to the IP address or hostname of the SNMP trap receiver.
