// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_connecting-openstack.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Connecting {OpenStack} to {Project}

To collect metrics, events, or both, and to send then back to the {ProjectShort} STF storage domain, the {OpenStack} overcloud needs to be configured to enable data collect and transport. If you want to deploy with routed L3 networks (such as DCN or Spine and Leaf), see <<deploying-with-routed-l3-networks_completing-the-stf-configuration>>.
