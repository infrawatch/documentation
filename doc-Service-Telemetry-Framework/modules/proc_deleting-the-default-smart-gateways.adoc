// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc

// * Title: = Doing procedure A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing

//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also

= Deleting the default Smart Gateways

[role="_abstract"]
After you configure {ProjectShort} for multiple clouds, you can delete the default Smart Gateways if they are no longer in use. The Service Telemetry Operator can remove `SmartGateway` objects that have been created but are no longer listed in the ServiceTelemetry `clouds` list of objects. To enable the removal of SmartGateway objects that are not defined by the `clouds` parameter, you must set the `cloudsRemoveOnMissing` parameter to `true` in the `ServiceTelemetry` manifest.

TIP: If you do not want to deploy any Smart Gateways, define an empty clouds object by using the `clouds: {}` parameter.

WARNING: The `cloudsRemoveOnMissing` parameter is disabled by default. If you enable the `cloudsRemoveOnMissing` parameter, you remove any manually created `SmartGateway` objects in the current namespace without any possibility to restore.

.Procedure

. Define your `clouds` parameter with the list of cloud objects to be managed by the Service Telemetry Operator. For more information, see xref:clouds_assembly-installing-the-core-components-of-stf[].

. Edit the ServiceTelemetry object and add the `cloudsRemoveOnMissing` parameter:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: infra.watch/v1beta1
kind: ServiceTelemetry
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  cloudsRemoveOnMissing: true
  clouds:
    ...
----

. Save the modifications.

. Verify that the Operator deleted the Smart Gateways. This can take several minutes while the Operators reconcile the changes:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get smartgateways
----
