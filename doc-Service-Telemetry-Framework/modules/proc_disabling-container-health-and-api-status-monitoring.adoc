= Disabling container health and API status monitoring

[role="_abstract"]

To disable {OpenStackShort} containerized service health and API status monitoring, you must set the `CollectdEnableSensubility` parameter to `false`.

.Prerequisites

* You have created the `stf-connectors.yaml` file in your templates directory. For more information, see xref:configuring-red-hat-openstack-platform-overcloud-for-stf_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].

* You are using the most current version of {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) {OpenStackVersion}.

.Procedure

. Open the `stf-connectors.yaml` and add the `CollectdEnableSensubility` parameter to override the setting in `enable-stf.yaml`. Ensure that `stf-connectors.yaml` is called from the `openstack overcloud deploy` command after `enable-stf.yaml`:

. Continue with the overcloud deployment procedure. For more information, see xref:deploying-the-overcloud_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
