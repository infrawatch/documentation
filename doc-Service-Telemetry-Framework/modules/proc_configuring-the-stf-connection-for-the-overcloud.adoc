// Module included in the following assemblies:

// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_configuring-the-stf-connection-for-the-overcloud.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Configuring the {ProjectShort} connection for the overcloud

[role="_abstract"]
To configure the {ProjectShort} connection, you must create a file that contains the connection configuration of the {MessageBus} for the overcloud to the {ProjectShort} deployment. Enable the collection of events and storage of the events in {ProjectShort} and deploy the overcloud. The configuration is set up for a single cloud instance with the default message bus topics. For configuration of multiple cloud deployments, see xref:configuring-multiple-clouds_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].

.Prerequisites

ifdef::include_when_13[]
* Retrieve the CA certificate from the {MessageBus} deployed by {ProjectShort}. For more information, see xref:getting-ca-certificate-from-stf-for-overcloud-configuration_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
endif::include_when_13[]
* Retrieve the {MessageBus} route address. For more information, see xref:retrieving-the-qdr-route-address_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].

.Procedure

. Log in to the {OpenStack} undercloud as the `stack` user.

. Create a configuration file called `stf-connectors.yaml` in the `/home/stack` directory.

. In the `stf-connectors.yaml` file, configure the `MetricsQdrConnectors` address to connect the {MessageBus} on the overcloud to the {ProjectShort} deployment.
* Replace the `host` parameter with the value of `HOST/PORT` that you retrieved in xref:retrieving-the-qdr-route-address_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
ifdef::include_when_13[]
* Replace the `caCertFileContent` parameter with the contents retrieved in xref:getting-ca-certificate-from-stf-for-overcloud-configuration_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
