= Creating the {OpenStack} environment file for multiple clouds

[role="_abstract"]
To label traffic according to the cloud of origin, you must create a configuration with cloud-specific instance names. Create an `stf-connectors.yaml` file and adjust the values of `CeilometerQdrMetricsConfig` and `CollectdAmqpInstances` to match the AMQP address prefix scheme.

ifdef::include_when_16[]
[NOTE]
If you enabled container health and API status monitoring, you must also modify the `CollectdSensubilityResultsChannel` parameter. For more information, see xref:container-health-and-api-status_assembly-advanced-features[].

.Prerequisites

ifdef::include_when_13,include_when_17[* You have retrieved the CA certificate from the {MessageBus} deployed by {ProjectShort}. For more information, see xref:getting-ca-certificate-from-stf-for-overcloud-configuration_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].]
* You have created your list of clouds objects. For more information about creating the content for the clouds parameter, see the xref:clouds_assembly-installing-the-core-components-of-stf[clouds configuration parameter].
* You have retrieved the {MessageBus} route address. For more information, see xref:retrieving-the-qdr-route-address_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
* You have created the base configuration for {ProjectShort}. For more information, see xref:creating-the-base-configuration-for-stf_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
* You have created a unique domain name environment file. For more information, see xref:setting-a-unique-cloud-domain_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].

.Procedure

. Log in to the undercloud host as the `stack` user.

. Create a configuration file called `stf-connectors.yaml` in the `/home/stack` directory.

ifdef::include_when_13[]
. In the `stf-connectors.yaml` file, configure the `MetricsQdrConnectors` address to connect to the {MessageBus} on the overcloud deployment. Configure the `CeilometerQdrMetricsConfig`, and `CollectdAmqpInstances` topic values to match the AMQP address that you want for this cloud deployment.
endif::include_when_13[]
ifndef::include_when_13[]
. In the `stf-connectors.yaml` file, configure the `MetricsQdrConnectors` address to connect to the {MessageBus} on the overcloud deployment. Configure the `CeilometerQdrMetricsConfig`, `CollectdAmqpInstances`, and `CollectdSensubilityResultsChannel` topic values to match the AMQP address that you want for this cloud deployment.
endif::include_when_13[]

// The following configuration should match the contents in modules/proc_configuring-the-stf-connection-for-the-overcloud.adoc. If you have changes to make, please make the same changes to both files.

* The `qdr::router_id` configuration is to override the default value which uses the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the host. In some cases the FQDN can result in a router ID length of greater than 61 characters which results in failed QDR connections. For deployments with shorter FQDN values this is not necessary.
* The `resource_registry` configuration directly loads the collectd service because you do not include the `collectd-write-qdr.yaml` environment file for multiple cloud deployments.
* Replace the `host` parameter with the value that you retrieved in xref:retrieving-the-qdr-route-address_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
ifdef::include_when_13,include_when_17[]
* Replace the `caCertFileContent` parameter with the contents retrieved in xref:getting-ca-certificate-from-stf-for-overcloud-configuration_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
endif::include_when_13,include_when_17[]
* Replace the `host` sub-parameter of `MetricsQdrConnectors` with the value that you retrieved in xref:retrieving-the-qdr-route-address_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
* Set `topic` value of `CeilometerQdrMetricsConfig.topic` to define the topic for Ceilometer metrics. The value is a unique topic identifier for the cloud such as `cloud1-metering`.
* Set `CollectdAmqpInstances` sub-parameter to define the topic for collectd metrics. The section name is a unique topic identifier for the cloud such as `cloud1-telemetry`.
ifndef::include_when_13[]
* Set `CollectdSensubilityResultsChannel` to define the topic for collectd-sensubility events. The value is a unique topic identifier for the cloud such as `sensubility/cloud1-telemetry`.
endif::[]
+
[NOTE]
====
When you define the topics for collectd and Ceilometer, the value you provide is transposed into the full topic that the Smart Gateway client uses to listen for messages.

Ceilometer topic values are transposed into the topic address `anycast/ceilometer/<TOPIC>.sample` and collectd topic values are transposed into the topic address `collectd/<TOPIC>`.
ifndef::include_when_13[The value for sensubility is the full topic path and has no transposition from topic value to topic address.]

For an example of a cloud configuration in the `ServiceTelemetry` object referring to the full topic address, see xref:clouds_assembly-installing-the-core-components-of-stf[].
====

. Ensure that the naming convention in the `stf-connectors.yaml` file aligns with the `spec.bridge.amqpUrl` field in the Smart Gateway configuration. For example, configure the `CeilometerQdrMetricsConfig.topic` field to a value of `cloud1-metering`.

. Log in to the undercloud host as the `stack` user.

. Source the `stackrc` undercloud credentials file:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ source stackrc
----

. Include the `stf-connectors.yaml` file and unique domain name environment file `hostnames.yaml` in the `openstack overcloud deployment` command, with any other environment files relevant to your environment:
+
[WARNING]
If you use the `collectd-write-qdr.yaml` file with a custom `CollectdAmqpInstances` parameter, data publishes to the custom and default topics. In a multiple cloud environment, the configuration of the `resource_registry` parameter in the `stf-connectors.yaml` file loads the collectd service.
