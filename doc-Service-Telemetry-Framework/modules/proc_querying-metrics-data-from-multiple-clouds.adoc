= Querying metrics data from multiple clouds

[role="_abstract"]
Data stored in Prometheus has a `service` label attached according to the Smart Gateway it was scraped from. You can use this label to query data from a specific cloud.

To query data from a specific cloud, use a Prometheus _promql_ query that matches the associated `service` label; for example: `collectd_uptime{service="default-cloud1-coll-meter"}`.
