= Observability Strategy in Service Telemetry Framework

[role="_abstract"]
{Project} ({ProjectShort}) does not include storage backends and alerting tools. {ProjectShort} uses community operators to deploy Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, and Elasticsearch. {ProjectShort} makes requests to these community operators to create instances of each application configured to work with {ProjectShort}.

Instead of having Service Telemetry Operator create custom resource requests, you can use your own deployments of these applications or other compatible applications, and scrape the metrics Smart Gateways for delivery to your own Prometheus-compatible system for telemetry storage. If you set the observability strategy to use alternative backends instead, persistent storage is not required for {ProjectShort}.
