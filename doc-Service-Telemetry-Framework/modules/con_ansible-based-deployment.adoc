* Consolidation of configuration under a single service-specific THT variable (MetricsQdrVars and CollectdVars)
* The ability to switch QDR modes from mesh-mode to edge-only and back
* Fewer technologies used in the deployment stack, resulting in a simpler debug process

To use the Ansible-based deployment, substitute the word "ansible" in place of "puppet" in the `resource_registry` section of your `stf-connectors.yaml` file:
[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
    OS::TripleO::Services::Collectd: /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/deployment/metrics/collectd-container-ansible.yaml
    OS::TripleO::Services::MetricsQdr: /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/deployment/metrics/qdr-container-ansible.yaml
----

To set the configuration, use the new service-specific THT variables, as shown in the following example:
[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
parameter_defaults:
  MetricsQdrVars:
    tripleo_metrics_qdr_deployment_mode: edge-only
  CollectdVars:
    tripleo_collectd_amqp_host: stf.mycluster.example.com

The full list of supported configuration parameters can be found in the deployment files referenced above.
