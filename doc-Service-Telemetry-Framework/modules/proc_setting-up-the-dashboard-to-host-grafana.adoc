// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_setting-up-the-dashboard-to-host-grafana.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

Grafana is not included in the default {Project} ({ProjectShort}) deployment so you must deploy the Grafana Operator from OperatorHub.io. For more information about enabling the OperatorHub.io catalog source, see <<enabling-the-operatorhubio-community-catalog-source>>:

. Clone the dashboard repository.
+
----
git clone https://github.com/infrawatch/dashboards
cd dashboards
----

. Change to the `service-telemetry` namespace and deploy the Grafana operator:
+
----
oc project service-telemetry
oc create -f deploy/subscription.yaml
----

. Launch a Grafana instance:
+
----
oc create -f deploy/grafana.yaml
----

. Create the datasource and dashboard resources:
+
----
oc create -f deploy/datasource.yaml \
    -f deploy/rhos-dashboard.yaml
----

. Navigate to https://<grafana-route-address> in a web browser. Use `oc get routes` to retrieve the Grafana route address:
+
----
oc get routes
----

. To view the dashboard, click *Dashboards* and *Manage*.
