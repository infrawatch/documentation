// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/ref_manifest-override-parameters.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: ref_my-reference-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='ref_my-reference-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My reference A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.

= Monitoring container health and API status

[role="_abstract"]
Container health assesses the status of each of the {OpenStack} service containers by periodically running a health check script using the OCI (Open Container Initiative) standard. Most {OpenStack} services implement a health check that logs issues and returns a binary status. For the {OpenStack} APIs, the health checks query the root endpoint and determine the health based on the response time.

To monitor healthchecks in {Project} ({ProjectShort}), you must enable and configure the `collectd-sensubility` plugin to work with the `amqp1` protocol and configure the the amqp1 address. Container health monitoring is enabled by default in `enable-stf.yaml`. For more information, see xref:creating-the-base-configuration-for-stf_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].

.Prerequisites

* You have created the `stf-connectors.yaml` file in your templates directory. For more information, see xref:configuring-red-hat-openstack-platform-overcloud-for-stf_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].

* You are using the most current version of {OpenStack} {OpenStackVersion}.

.Procedure

To disable the monitoring of container health status disable `CollectdEnableSensubility`.

. Open the `stf-connectors.yaml` and add the `CollectdEnableSensubility` parameter to override the setting in `enable-stf.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
CollectdEnableSensubility: false
----

. Continue with the overcloud deployment procedure. For more information, see xref:deploying-the-overcloud_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].

* For more information about multiple cloud addresses, see xref:configuring-multiple-clouds_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
