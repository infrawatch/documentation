. To verify the configuration is loaded into Alertmanager, create a pod with access to `curl`:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc run curl --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty
----


. Run the `curl` command against the `alertmanager-operated` service to retrieve the status and `configYAML` contents, and verify that the supplied configuration matches the configuration in Alertmanager:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
[ root@curl:/ ]$ curl alertmanager-operated:9093/api/v1/status

{"status":"success","data":{"configYAML":"...",...}}
----

. Verify that the `configYAML` field contains the changes you expect.

. Exit the pod:
+
[source,bash]
----
[ root@curl:/ ]$ exit
----

. To clean up the environment, delete the `curl` pod:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete pod curl

pod "curl" deleted
----
