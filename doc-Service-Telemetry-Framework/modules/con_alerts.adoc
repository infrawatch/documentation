// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_alerts.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

You create alert rules in Prometheus and alert routes in Alertmanager. Alert rules in Prometheus servers send alerts to an Alertmanager, which manages the alerts. Alertmanager can silence, inhibit, or aggregate alerts, and send notifications by using email, on-call notification systems, or chat platforms.

To create an alert, complete the following tasks:

. Create an alert rule in Prometheus. For more information, see xref:creating-an-alert-rule-in-prometheus_assembly-advanced-features[].
. Create an alert route in Alertmanager. There are two ways in which you can create an alert route:
** xref:creating-an-alert-route-in-alertmanager_assembly-advanced-features[Creating a standard alert route in Alertmanager].
** xref:creating-an-alert-route-with-templating-in-alertmanager_assembly-advanced-features[Creating an alert route with templating in Alertmanager].
