// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_manifest-features.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Monitoring the resource usage of {OpenStack} services

[role="_abstract"]
Monitor the resource usage of the {OpenStack} services, such as the APIs and other infrastructure processes, to identify bottlenecks in the overcloud by showing services running out of compute power. Enable the `collectd-libpod-stats` plug-in to gather CPU and memory usage metrics for every container running in the overcloud.

.Prerequisites

* You have created the `stf-connectors.yaml` file. For more information, see xref:configuring-red-hat-openstack-platform-overcloud-for-stf_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
* You are using the most current version of {OpenStack}: {OpenStackVersion}.

.Procedure

. Open the `stf-connectors.yaml` file.

. Add the following configuration to `parameter_defaults`:
+
----
  CollectdEnableLibpodstats: true
----

. Continue with the overcloud deployment procedure.
