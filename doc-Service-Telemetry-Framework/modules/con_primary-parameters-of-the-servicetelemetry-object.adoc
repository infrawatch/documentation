= Primary parameters of the ServiceTelemetry object

[role="_abstract"]
The `ServiceTelemetry` object is made up of the following major configuration parameters:

* `alerting`
* `backends`
* `clouds`
* `graphing`
* `highAvailability`
* `transports`

Each of these top-level configuration parameters provides various controls for a {ProjectShort} deployment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Support for `servicetelemetry.infra.watch/v1alpha1` was removed from {ProjectShort} 1.3.
====

[id="backends_{context}"]
== backends

Use the `backends` parameter to control which storage backends are available for storage of metrics and events, and to control the enablement of Smart Gateways, as defined by the `clouds` parameter. For more information, see xref:clouds_assembly-installing-the-core-components-of-stf[].

Currently, you can use Prometheus as the metrics storage backend and ElasticSearch as the events storage backend.

=== Enabling Prometheus as a storage backend for metrics

.Procedure

* To enable Prometheus as a storage backend for metrics, configure the `ServiceTelemetry` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: infra.watch/v1beta1
kind: ServiceTelemetry
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: service-telemetry
spec:
  backends:
    metrics:
      prometheus:
        enabled: true
----

[discrete]
=== Enabling ElasticSearch as a storage backend for events

To enable events support in {ProjectShort}, you must enable the Elastic Cloud for Kubernetes Operator. For more information, see xref:subscribing-to-the-elastic-cloud-on-kubernetes-operator_assembly-installing-the-core-components-of-stf[].

By default, storage of events on ElasticSearch is disabled. For more information, see xref:deploying-stf-to-the-openshift-environment-with-elasticsearch_assembly-installing-the-core-components-of-stf[].

.Procedure

* To enable ElasticSearch as a storage backend for events, configure the `ServiceTelemetry` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: infra.watch/v1beta1
kind: ServiceTelemetry
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: service-telemetry
spec:
  backends:
    events:
      elasticsearch:
        enabled: true
----

[id="clouds_{context}"]
== clouds

Use the `clouds` parameter to control which Smart Gateway objects are deployed, thereby providing the interface for multiple monitored cloud environments to connect to an instance of {ProjectShort}. If a supporting backend is available, then metrics and events Smart Gateways for the default cloud configuration are created. By default, the Service Telemetry Operator creates Smart Gateways for `cloud1`.

You can create a list of cloud objects to control which Smart Gateways are created for the defined clouds. Each cloud consists of data types and collectors. Data types are `metrics` or `events`. Each data type is made up of a list of collectors, the message bus subscription address, and whether debugging is enabled. Available collectors for metrics are `collectd`, `ceilometer`, and `sensubility`. Available collectors for events are `collectd` and `ceilometer`. Ensure that the subscription address for each of these collectors is unique for every cloud, data type, and collector combination.

The default `cloud1` configuration is represented by the following `ServiceTelemetry` object, providing subscriptions and data storage of metrics and events for collectd, Ceilometer, and Sensubility data collectors for a particular cloud instance:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: infra.watch/v1beta1
kind: ServiceTelemetry
metadata:
  name: stf-default
  namespace: service-telemetry
spec:
  clouds:
    - name: cloud1
      metrics:
        collectors:
          - collectorType: collectd
            subscriptionAddress: collectd/telemetry
          - collectorType: ceilometer
            subscriptionAddress: anycast/ceilometer/metering.sample
          - collectorType: sensubility
            subscriptionAddress: sensubility/telemetry
            debugEnabled: false
      events:
        collectors:
          - collectorType: collectd
            subscriptionAddress: collectd/notify
          - collectorType: ceilometer
            subscriptionAddress: anycast/ceilometer/event.sample
----

Each item of the `clouds` parameter represents a cloud instance. The cloud instances are made up of three top-level parameters: `name`, `metrics`, and `events`. The `metrics` and `events` parameters represent the corresponding backend for storage of that data type. The `collectors` parameter specifies a list of objects made up of two required parameters, `collectorType` and `subscriptionAddress`, and these represent an instance of the Smart Gateway. The `collectorType` parameter specifies data collected by either collectd or Ceilometer. The `subscriptionAddress` parameter provides the {MessageBus} address to which a Smart Gateway should subscribe.

You can use the optional Boolean parameter `debugEnabled` within the `collectors` parameter to enable additional console debugging in the running Smart Gateway pod.

[id="alerting_{context}"]
== alerting

Use the `alerting` parameter to control creation of an Alertmanager instance and the configuration of the storage backend. By default, `alerting` is enabled. For more information, see xref:alerts_assembly-advanced-features[].

[id="graphing_{context}"]
== graphing

Use the `graphing` parameter to control the creation of a Grafana instance. By default, `graphing` is disabled. For more information, see xref:dashboards_assembly-advanced-features[].

[id="highAvailability_{context}"]
== highAvailability

Use the `highAvailability` parameter to control the instantiation of multiple copies of {ProjectShort} components to reduce recovery time of components that fail or are rescheduled. By default, `highAvailability` is disabled. For more information, see xref:high-availability_assembly-advanced-features[].

[id="transports_{context}"]
== transports

Use the `transports` parameter to control the enablement of the message bus for a {ProjectShort} deployment. The only transport currently supported is {MessageBus}. By default, the `qdr` transport is enabled.
