= {OpenStack} API status and containerized services health

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the OCI (Open Container Initiative) standard to assess the container health status of each {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) service by periodically running a health check script. Most {OpenStackShort} services implement a health check that logs issues and returns a binary status. For the {OpenStackShort} APIs, the health checks query the root endpoint and determine the health based on the response time.

Monitoring of {OpenStackShort} container health and API status is enabled by default.
