// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_sizing-your-installation.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Installation size

The size of your installation depends on the following factors:

* The number of nodes being monitored.
* The number of metrics being collected.
* The resolution of metrics.
* The length of time that you want to store the data.

The size of the virtual machines for {OpenShift} has the largest impact
on the hardware requirements, including the number of virtual machines. For
more information about the recommended sizing for the OpenShift nodes, see
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/installing_clusters/index#production-level-hardware-requirements[Production
Level Hardware Requirements] in the OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 documentation.
