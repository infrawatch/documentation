= Disabling {OpenStack} services used with {Project}

[role="_abstract"]
Disable the services used when deploying {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) and connecting it to {Project} ({ProjectShort}).  There is no removal of logs or generated configuration files as part of the disablement of the services.

[WARNING]
Do not use this procedure when also using the xref:sending-metrics-to-gnocchi-and-to-stf_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[] procedure because the `gnocchi-connectors.yaml` does not contain all dependencies required. If you want to remove {ProjectShort}-related services on {OpenStackShort}, ensure that you update your environment to enable data collection and data storage dependencies.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {OpenStackShort} undercloud as the `stack` user.

. Source the authentication file:
+
[source,bash]
----
[stack@undercloud-0 ~]$ source stackrc

(undercloud) [stack@undercloud-0 ~]$
----

. Create the `disable-stf.yaml` environment file:
+
[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
(undercloud) [stack@undercloud-0]$ cat > $HOME/disable-stf.yaml <<EOF
---
resource_registry:
  OS::TripleO::Services::CeilometerAgentCentral: OS::Heat::None
  OS::TripleO::Services::CeilometerAgentNotification: OS::Heat::None
  OS::TripleO::Services::CeilometerAgentIpmi: OS::Heat::None
  OS::TripleO::Services::ComputeCeilometerAgent: OS::Heat::None
  OS::TripleO::Services::Redis: OS::Heat::None
  OS::TripleO::Services::Collectd: OS::Heat::None
  OS::TripleO::Services::MetricsQdr: OS::Heat::None
EOF
----

. Remove the following files from your {OpenStackShort} {OpenStackInstaller} deployment:
+
* `ceilometer-write-qdr.yaml`
* `qdr-edge-only.yaml`
* `enable-stf.yaml`
* `stf-connectors.yaml`

. Update the {OpenStackShort} overcloud using `openstack overcloud deploy` with the `disable-stf.yaml` early in the list of environment files. If the disable-stf.yaml file is used late in the list of environment files, services that are dependended on by other services could be disabled when not intended. By adding disable-stf.yaml early in the list, other environment files can override the configuration that would disable the service:
+
// this one is actually a valid use of subs +quotes. We want the underbars to result in emphasis when generated.

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
