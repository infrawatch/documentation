// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_configuring-stf-for-multi-cloud.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Configuring multiple clouds

To configure multiple {OpenStack} clouds to target a single instance of {Project} ({ProjectShort}), complete the following tasks:

. Plan the AMQP address prefixes to use for each cloud. For more information, see <<planning-amqp-address-prefixes_advanced-features>>.
. Deploy metrics and events consumer Smart Gateways for each cloud to listen on the corresponding address prefixes. For more information, see <<deploying-smart-gateways_advanced-features>>.
. Configure each cloud to send its metrics and events to {ProjectShort} on the correct address. For more information, see <<creating-openstack-environment-file_advanced-features>>.

This diagram demonstrates how two {OpenStack} clouds connect to {ProjectShort}.
