// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_planning-amqp-address-prefixes.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Planning AMQP address prefixes

By default, {OpenStack} nodes get data through two data collectors; collectd and Ceilometer. These components send telemetry data or notifications to the respective AMQP addresses, for example, `collectd/telemetry`, where {ProjectShort} Smart Gateways listen on those addresses for monitoring data.

To support multiple clouds and to identify which cloud generated the monitoring data, configure each cloud to send data to a unique address. Prefix a cloud identifier to the second part of the address. The following list shows some example addresses and identifiers:

* `collectd/cloud1-telemetry`
* `collectd/cloud1-notify`
* `anycast/ceilometer/cloud1-metering.sample`
* `anycast/ceilometer/cloud1-event.sample`
* `collectd/cloud2-telemetry`
* `collectd/cloud2-notify`
* `anycast/ceilometer/cloud2-metering.sample`
* `anycast/ceilometer/cloud2-event.sample`
* `collectd/us-east-1-telemetry`
* `collectd/us-west-3-telemetry`
