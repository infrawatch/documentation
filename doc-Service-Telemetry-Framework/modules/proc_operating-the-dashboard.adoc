// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_operating-the-dashboard.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

== CPU panels
Panels pertaining to CPU usage of the node.
|===
|**Panel** | **Unit** | **Description**

| Current CPU Usage |
percent |
Instantaneous usage at the time of the last query


| Aggregate CPU Usage |
percent |
Average non-idle CPU activity of all cores on node


| Aggr. CPU Usage by Type |
percent |
Shows time spent for each type of thread averaged across all cores
|===


== Memory panels
Panels pertaining to memory usage on the node.

|===
|**Panel** | **Unit** | **Description**


| Memory Used |
percent |
Amount of memory being used at time of last query


| Huge Pages Used |
hugepages |
Number of hugepages being used


Memory |
bytes |
Memory marked as “used” by the OS
|===


== Disk/file system
Panels pertaining to space used on disk.

|===
|**Panel** | **Unit** | **Description** | **Notes**

| Disk Space Usage |
percent |
Total disk use at time of last query |


| Inode Usage |
percent |
Total inode use at time of last query |


| Aggregate Disk Space Usage |
bytes |
Total disk space used and reserved. |
Because this query relies on the `df` plugin, temporary file systems that do not necessarily use disk space are included in the results. The query tries to filter out most of these, but it might not be exhaustive

| Disk Traffic |
bytes/s |
Shows rates for both reading and writing. |


| Disk Load |
percent |
Approximate percentage of total disk bandwidth being used.
The weighted I/O time series includes the backlog that might be accumulating. For more information, see the collectd https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Disk[disk plugin docs]  |


| Operations/s |
ops/s |
Operations done per second |


| Average I/O Operation Time |
seconds |
Average time each I/O operation took to complete. Per the collectd https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Disk[disk plugin docs], this average is not accurate. |
