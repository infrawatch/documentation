// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_generating-the-manifests-for-stf.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Generating the manifests for {ProjectShort}

Several of the manifests that are required for deployment are dynamically generated by
Ansible.

NOTE: Ansible version 2.7 or later is recommended.

. To generate the additional manifests for {ProjectShort}, log
in to the {OpenShiftShort} environment within the `sa-telemetry`
namespace and run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook \
-e "registry_path=$(oc registry info)" \
-e "imagestream_namespace=$(oc project --short)" \
deploy_builder.yml
----

. By default, a persistent volume claim (PVC) of 20G is requested for
Prometheus. To adjust the default PVC size, insert `-e
"prometheus_pvc_storage_request=<size_in_gigabytes>G"` before
`deploy_builder.yml` in the command.

[TIP]
====
You can view additional overrides in the `deploy/roles/deploy.builder/defaults/main.yml` file located in the
telemetry-framework release directory.
