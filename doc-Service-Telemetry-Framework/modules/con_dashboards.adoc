Use the third-party application, Grafana, to visualize system-level metrics that the data collectors collectd and Ceilometer gather for each individual host node.

For more information about configuring data collectors, see xref:configuring-red-hat-openstack-platform-overcloud-for-stf_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].

//TODO: can re-work this once we have OSP13 dashboard(s) to show. Can't use container health checks or monitoring in OSP13.
You can use dashboards to monitor a cloud:

Infrastructure dashboard::
Use the infrastructure dashboard to view metrics for a single node at a time. Select a node from the upper left corner of the dashboard.

Cloud view dashboard::
Use the cloud view dashboard to view panels to monitor service resource usage, API stats, and cloud events. You must enable API health monitoring and service monitoring to provide the data for this dashboard. API health monitoring is enabled by default in the {ProjectShort} base configuration. For more information, see xref:creating-the-base-configuration-for-stf_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
** For more information about API health monitoring, see xref:container-health-and-api-status_assembly-advanced-features[].
** For more information about {OpenStackShort} service monitoring, see xref:resource-usage-of-openstack-services_assembly-advanced-features[].

Virtual machine view dashboard::
Use the virtual machine view dashboard to view panels to monitor virtual machine infrastructure usage. Select a cloud and project from the upper left corner of the dashboard. You must enable event storage if you want to enable the event annotations on this dashboard. For more information, see xref:creating-a-servicetelemetry-object-in-openshift_assembly-installing-the-core-components-of-stf[].

Memcached view dashboard::
Use the memcached view dashboard to view panels to monitor connections, availability, system metrics and cache performance. Select a cloud from the upper left corner of the dashboard.
