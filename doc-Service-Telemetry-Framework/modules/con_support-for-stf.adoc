// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_support-for-project.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

Red Hat supports the two most recent versions of {Project} ({ProjectShort}). Earlier versions are not supported. For more information, see the https://access.redhat.com/articles/5662081[{Project} Supported Version Matrix].

Red Hat supports the core Operators and workloads, including {MessageBus}, AMQ Certificate Manager, Service Telemetry Operator, and Smart Gateway Operator. Red Hat does not support the community Operators or workload components, inclusive of ElasticSearch, Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, and their Operators.

{ProjectShort} does not work in {OpenShift} disconnected environments due to dependencies on components that are not yet available for installation in a disconnected environment.
