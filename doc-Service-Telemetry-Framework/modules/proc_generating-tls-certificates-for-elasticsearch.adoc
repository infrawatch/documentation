// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_generating-tls-certificates-for-elasticsearch.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Generating TLS certificates for ElasticSearch

To connect the Smart Gateway to ElasticSearch for events storage, generate certificates and load them as a secret into {OpenShiftShort}.

. Generate the unsigned certificates. If you have signed certificates to load
into {OpenShiftShort}, go to <<deploying-stf-to-the-openshift-environment_installing-the-core-components-of-stf>>.
