// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_estimating-storage-requirements-for-prometheus.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Estimating storage requirements for Prometheus

On average, Prometheus uses only around 1-2 bytes per sample. To plan the capacity of a Prometheus server, you can use this formula:
`needed_disk_space = retention_time_seconds * ingested_samples_per_second * bytes_per_sample`

[NOTE]
The result of this formula is an approximate size for the Prometheus server.

In default settings, the retention time is 86400 seconds, and we are assuming 2 bytes per sample.

NOTE:
In {ProjectShort}, Prometheus consumes monitoring metrics about itself along with other components within the framework, meaning the rate of incoming metrics is not merely those coming from the cloud being monitored. The `ingested_samples_per_second` variable will need to be measured at Prometheus for this formula to work.
