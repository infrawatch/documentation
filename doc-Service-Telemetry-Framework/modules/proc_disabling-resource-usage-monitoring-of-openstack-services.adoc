= Disabling resource usage monitoring of {OpenStack} services

To disable the monitoring of {OpenStackShort} containerized service resource usage, you must set the `CollectdEnableLibpodstats` parameter to `false`.

.Prerequisites

* You have created the `stf-connectors.yaml` file. For more information, see xref:configuring-red-hat-openstack-platform-overcloud-for-stf_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
* You are using the most current version of {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) {OpenStackVersion}.

.Procedure

. Open the `stf-connectors.yaml` file and add the `CollectdEnableLibpodstats` parameter to override the setting in `enable-stf.yaml`. Ensure that `stf-connectors.yaml` is called from the `openstack overcloud deploy` command after `enable-stf.yaml`:

  CollectdEnableLibpodstats: false

. Continue with the overcloud deployment procedure. For more information, see xref:deploying-the-overcloud_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
