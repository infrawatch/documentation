// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_generating-a-tls-certificate-for-amq-interconnect.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Generating a TLS certificate for {MessageBus}

Use TLS/SSL certificates to route the remote {MessageBus} connections through the {OpenShiftShort} router. The following commands create the appropriate certificate files locally and load the contents into a secret for {MessageBus} to use. The {MessageBus} message bus on the client side connects to the route address
(DNS address) for the {MessageBus} service on port 443.

. Generate an unsigned certificate. If you have a signed certificate to load
into {OpenShiftShort}, proceed to step 2.

    openssl req -new -x509 -batch -nodes -days 11000 \

      -out /tmp/tls.crt \
      -keyout /tmp/tls.key

. Use the oc command to import the certificate into {OpenShiftShort}:
