// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_ephemeral-storage.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Ephemeral Storage

Use ephemeral storage to run {Project} ({ProjectShort}) without persistently storing data in your {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort}) cluster.  Ephemeral storage is not recommended in a production environment due to the volatility of the data in the platform when operating correctly and as designed. For example, restarting a pod or rescheduling the workload to another node results in the loss of any local data written since the pod started.

If you enable ephemeral storage in {ProjectShort}, the Service Telemetry Operator does not add the relevant `storage` sections to the data storage components manifests.
