= Updating the {MessageBus} CA Certificate on Red Hat OpenStack Platform

After you upgrade to {Project} ({ProjectShort}) v1.5, the CA certificate for {MessageBus} regenerates. In {ProjectShort} v1.4 the CA certificate for {MessageBus} is valid for three months and must be updated periodically in {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}). In {ProjectShort} v1.5, the generated certificates are valid for the lifetime of the {OpenStackShort} lifecycle, 70080 hours by default.

.Prerequisites

* You have successfully installed {ProjectShort} v1.5 and updated the CA certificate for {MessageBus}.
