// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_prerequisites-for-stf-deployment.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

Complete the following prerequisite tasks:

. Install a suitable platform on which to install {Openshift} ({OpenShiftShort}), for
example,
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/[Red
Hat OpenStack Platform]. If you already have an {OpenShiftShort} 3.11
environment, see
<<preparing-your-openshift-environment-for-stf_installing-the-core-components-of-stf>>.

. Install {OpenShiftShort}. For more information, see
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/installing_clusters/index[OpenShift
Container Platform 3.11 Installing Clusters] in the OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 documentation..

. Deploy {OpenShiftShort} 3.11 client tools and a bastion node, which executes
the supplied bash script to load the components into the `sa-telemetry`
namespace.
