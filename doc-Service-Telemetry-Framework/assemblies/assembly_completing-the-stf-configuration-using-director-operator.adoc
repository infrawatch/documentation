= Configuring {OpenStack} director Operator for {Project}

:context: assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration-using-director-operator

[role="_abstract"]
To collect metrics, events, or both, and to send them to the {Project} ({ProjectShort}) storage domain, you must configure the {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) overcloud to enable data collection and transport.

{ProjectShort} can support both single and multiple clouds. The default configuration in {OpenStackShort} and {ProjectShort} set up for a single cloud installation.

* For a single {OpenStackShort} overcloud deployment using director Operator with default configuration, see xref:configuring-red-hat-openstack-platform-overcloud-for-stf-using-director-operator_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration-using-director-operator[].
