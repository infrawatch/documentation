To migrate from {Project} ({ProjectShort}) v1.1 to {ProjectShort} v1.2, you must replace the `ClusterServiceVersion` and `Subscription` objects in the `service-telemetry` namespace on your {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort}) v4.5 environment.

.Prerequisites

* When you upgrade the {OpenShiftShort} environment from v4.5 to v4.6, ensure that you add the AMQ Certificate Manager Operator from the `redhat-operators-stf` CatalogSource. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.1/html/service_telemetry_framework_1.2/assembly-installing-the-core-components-of-stf_assembly#subscribing-to-the-amq-certificate-manager-operator[Subscribing to the AMQ Certificate Manager Operator].
* **Ensure that you backup data prior to any upgrade of the environment.** Upgrading {ProjectShort} v1.1 to v1.2 results in a brief outage while the Smart Gateways are upgraded. Additionally, changes to the `ServiceTelemetry` and `SmartGateway` objects will not have any effect while the Operators are being replaced.

To upgrade from {ProjectShort} v1.1 to v1.2, complete the following procedures:

.Procedure

. xref:removing-service-telemetry-framework-1-1-operators_assembly-upgrading-service-telemetry-framework-to-version-1-2[Remove the {ProjectShort} 1.1 Operators].
. xref:removing-the-service-telemetry-framework-v1-1-catalogsource_assembly-upgrading-service-telemetry-framework-to-version-1-2[Remove the {ProjectShort} 1.1 CatalogSource].
. xref:subscribing-to-the-service-telemetry-operator_assembly-upgrading-service-telemetry-framework-to-version-1-2[Subscribe to the Service Telemetry Operator].

include::../modules/proc_removing-the-service-telemetry-framework-v1-1-catalogsource.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::../modules/proc_subscribing-to-the-service-telemetry-operator.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

When the new Operators start, they reconcile the existing `ServiceTelemetry` and `SmartGateway` objects, resulting in the restart of Smart Gateway containers.

* To check the state of the Smart Gateway containers, use the `oc get pods` command:
