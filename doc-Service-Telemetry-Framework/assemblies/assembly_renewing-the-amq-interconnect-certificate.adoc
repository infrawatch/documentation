= Renewal of {MessageBus} Certificates

:context: assembly-qdr-cert-renewal

[role="_abstract"]
Periodically, the CA certificate used to secure the {MessageBus} connection between {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) and {Project} ({ProjectShort}) will expire and need to be replaced. The renewal is handled automatically by the cert-manager component in {OpenShift}, but you will need to manually copy the renewed certificate to your {OpenStackShort} nodes.
