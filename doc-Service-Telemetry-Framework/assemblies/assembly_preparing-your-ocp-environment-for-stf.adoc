[role="_abstract"]
To prepare your {OpenShift} environment for {Project} ({ProjectShort}), you must plan for persistent storage, adequate resources, and event storage:

* Ensure that persistent storage is available in your {OpenShift} cluster for a production grade deployment. For more information, see <<persistent-volumes_assembly-preparing-your-ocp-environment-for-stf>>.
* Ensure that enough resources are available to run the Operators and the application containers. For more information, see <<resource-allocation_assembly-preparing-your-ocp-environment-for-stf>>.

ifeval::["{build}" == "upstream"]
* {ProjectShort} uses ElasticSearch to store events, which requires a larger than normal `vm.max_map_count`. The `vm.max_map_count` value is set by default in {OpenShift}. For more information about how to edit the value of `vm.max_map_count`, see <<node-tuning-operator_assembly-preparing-your-ocp-environment-for-stf>>.
