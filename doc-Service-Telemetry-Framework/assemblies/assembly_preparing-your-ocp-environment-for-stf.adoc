// This assembly can be included from other assemblies using the following

// The following line is necessary to allow assemblies be included in other
// assemblies. It restores the `context` variable to its previous state.
:parent-context-of-preparing-your-ocp-environment-for-stf: {context}

// The file name and the ID are based on the assembly title.
// For example:
// * file name: assembly_my-assembly-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='assembly_my-assembly-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My assembly A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module.
// Avoid changing it after the module has been published
// to ensure existing links are not broken.
//
// In order for  the assembly to be reusable in other assemblies in a guide,
// include {context} in the ID: [id='a-collection-of-modules_{context}'].
//
// If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund
// form, such as Creating or Configuring.

= Preparing your {OpenShift} environment for {Project}

// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID
// includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if
// it is reused multiple times in a guide.

As you prepare your {OpenShiftShort} environment for {ProjectShort}, you must plan for persistent storage, adequate resources, and event storage:

* Ensure that persistent storage is available in your {OpenShift} cluster to permit a production grade deployment. For more information, see <<persistent-volumes_preparing-your-ocp-environment-for-stf>>.
* Ensure that enough resources are available to run the Operators and the application containers. For more information, see <<resource-allocation_preparing-your-ocp-environment-for-stf>>.
* To install ElasticSearch, you must use a community catalog source. If you do not want to use a community catalog or if you do not want to store events, see <<deploying-stf-to-the-openshift-environment_installing-the-core-components-of-stf>>.
* {ProjectShort} uses ElasticSearch to store events, which requires a larger than normal `vm.max_map_count`. The `vm.max_map_count` value is set by default in {OpenShift}. For more information about how to edit the value of `vm.max_map_count`, see <<node-tuning-operator_preparing-your-ocp-environment-for-stf>>.
