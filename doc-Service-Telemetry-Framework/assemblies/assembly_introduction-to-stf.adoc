{Project} ({ProjectShort}) collects monitoring data from {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) or third-party nodes. With {ProjectShort}, you can perform the following tasks:

* Store or archive the monitoring data for historical information
* View the monitoring data graphically on the dashboard
* Use the monitoring data to trigger alerts or warnings

The monitoring data can be either of two types:

Metric:: a numeric measurement of an application or system
Event:: irregular and discrete occurrences that happen in a system

The multicast message bus provides fast, reliable data transport and is shared by all the clients in the deployment. Other modular components that receive and store data are deployed in containers on {OpenShift}.
