// This assembly can be included from other assemblies using the following

// include::<path>/assembly_introduction-to-stf.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The following line is necessary to allow assemblies be included in other
// assemblies. It restores the `context` variable to its previous state.
:parent-context-of-introduction-to-stf: {context}

// The file name and the ID are based on the assembly title.
// For example:
// * file name: assembly_my-assembly-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='assembly_my-assembly-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My assembly A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module.
// Avoid changing it after the module has been published
// to ensure existing links are not broken.
//
// In order for  the assembly to be reusable in other assemblies in a guide,
// include {context} in the ID: [id='a-collection-of-modules_{context}'].
//
// If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund
// form, such as Creating or Configuring.
[id="introduction-to-stf_{context}"]
= Introduction to {Project}

// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID
// includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if
// it is reused multiple times in a guide.

{Project} ({ProjectShort}) receives monitoring data from {OpenStack} or third-party nodes for storage, dashboarding, and alerting. The monitoring data can be either of two types:

Metric:: a numeric measurement of an application or system
Event:: irregular and discrete occurrences that happen in a system

The collection components that are required on the clients are lightweight. The multicast message bus that is shared by all clients and the deployment provides fast and reliable data transport. Other modular components for receiving and storing data are deployed in containers on {OpenShiftShort}.

{ProjectShort} provides access to monitoring functions such as alert generation, visualization through dashboards, and single source of truth telemetry analysis to support orchestration.
