// This assembly is included in the following assemblies:

// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This assembly can be included from other assemblies using the following
// include statement:
// include::<path>/assembly_introduction-to-stf.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The following line is necessary to allow assemblies be included in other
// assemblies. It restores the `context` variable to its previous state.
:parent-context-of-introduction-to-stf: {context}

// The file name and the ID are based on the assembly title.
// For example:
// * file name: assembly_my-assembly-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='assembly_my-assembly-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My assembly A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module.
// Avoid changing it after the module has been published
// to ensure existing links are not broken.
//
// In order for  the assembly to be reusable in other assemblies in a guide,
// include {context} in the ID: [id='a-collection-of-modules_{context}'].
//
// If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund
// form, such as Creating or Configuring.
[id='introduction-to-stf_{context}']
= Introduction to {Project}

// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID
// includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if
// it is reused multiple times in a guide.

{Project} ({ProjectShort}) is an application that runs on {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort}). Use {ProjectShort} to collect metrics and record events from the nodes in your systems that you want to monitor. The metrics and event information travels on a message bus to the server side for storage. You can use this centralized information as the source for alerts, visualization, or the source of truth for orchestration frameworks.
{ProjectShort} provides metrics and events data collection from OpenStack infrastructure, fast and reliable transport of data, and built-in data storage and alerting capabilities. An advantage over other monitoring systems is its lighter weight and modular design.
