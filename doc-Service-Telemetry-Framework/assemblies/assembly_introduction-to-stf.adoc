{Project} ({ProjectShort}) collects monitoring data from {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) or third-party nodes. You can use {ProjectShort} to perform the following tasks:

* Store or archive the monitoring data for historical information.
* View the monitoring data graphically on the dashboard.
* Use the monitoring data to trigger alerts or warnings.

The monitoring data can be either metric or event:

Metric:: A numeric measurement of an application or system.
Event:: Irregular and discrete occurrences that happen in a system.

The components of {ProjectShort} use a message bus for data transport. Other modular components that receive and store data are deployed as containers on {OpenShift}.
