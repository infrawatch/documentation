To migrate from {Project} ({ProjectShort}) v1.2 to {ProjectShort} v1.3, you must replace the `ClusterServiceVersion` and `Subscription` objects in the `service-telemetry` namespace on your {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort}) environment.

.Prerequisites

* You have upgraded your {OpenShiftShort} environment to v4.6. {ProjectShort} v1.3 does not run on {OpenShiftShort} v4.5 and lower. {ProjectShort} v1.2 does not run on {OpenShiftShort} v4.7 and higher.
* You have backed up your data prior to any upgrade of the environment. Upgrading {ProjectShort} v1.2 to v1.3 results in a brief outage while the Smart Gateways are upgraded. Additionally, changes to the `ServiceTelemetry` and `SmartGateway` objects do not have any effect while the Operators are being replaced.

To upgrade from {ProjectShort} v1.2 to v1.3, complete the following procedures:

.Procedure

. xref:removing-service-telemetry-framework-1-2-operators_assembly-upgrading-service-telemetry-framework-to-version-1-3[Remove the {ProjectShort} 1.2 Operators].
. xref:subscribing-to-the-service-telemetry-operator_assembly-upgrading-service-telemetry-framework-to-version-1-3[Subscribe to the Service Telemetry Operator].


include::../modules/proc_removing-service-telemetry-framework-1-2-operators.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::../modules/proc_subscribing-to-the-service-telemetry-operator.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

When the new Operators start, they reconcile the existing `ServiceTelemetry` and `SmartGateway` objects, resulting in the restart of Smart Gateway containers.

* To check the state of the Smart Gateway containers, use the `oc get pods` command:
