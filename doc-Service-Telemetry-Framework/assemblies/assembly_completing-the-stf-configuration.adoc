[role="_abstract"]
To collect metrics, events, or both, and to send them to the {Project} ({ProjectShort}) storage domain, you must configure the {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}) overcloud to enable data collection and transport.

{ProjectShort} can support both single and multiple clouds. The default configuration in {OpenStackShort} and {ProjectShort} set up for a single cloud installation.

* For a single {OpenStackShort} overcloud deployment with default configuration, see xref:configuring-red-hat-openstack-platform-overcloud-for-stf_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].

* To plan your {OpenStackShort} installation and configuration {ProjectShort} for multiple clouds, see xref:configuring-multiple-clouds_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].

* As part of an {OpenStackShort} overcloud deployment, you might need to configure additional features in your environment:
// NOTE: removing this for now because it's not clear that this is necessary, and that recommendations here may actually be harmful. See RHBZ#2023902.
//** To deploy data collection and transport to {ProjectShort} on {OpenStackShort} cloud nodes that employ routed L3 domains, such as distributed compute node (DCN) or spine-leaf, see xref:deploying-to-non-standard-network-topologies_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
** To disable the data collector services, see xref:disabling-openstack-services-used-with-stf_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].

** If you synchronized container images to a local registry, you must create an environment file and include the paths to the container images. For more information, see xref:adding-container-images-to-the-undercloud_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
