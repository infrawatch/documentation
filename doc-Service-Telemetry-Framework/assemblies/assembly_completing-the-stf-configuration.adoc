To collect metrics, events, or both, and to send them to the {Project} ({ProjectShort}) storage domain, you must configure the {OpenStack} overcloud to enable data collection and transport.

To deploy data collection and transport to {ProjectShort} on {OpenStack} cloud nodes that employ routed L3 domains, such as distributed compute node (DCN) or spine-leaf, see xref:deploying-to-non-standard-network-topologies_assembly-completing-the-stf-configuration[].
