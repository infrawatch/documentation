= Upgrading {Project} to version 1.5

:context: upgrading-service-telemetry-framework-to-version-1-5

To upgrade {Project} ({ProjectShort}) v1.4 to {ProjectShort} v1.5, you must complete the following steps:

* Replace AMQ Certificate Manager with Certificate Manager.

* Remove the `ClusterServiceVersion` and `Subscription` objects for Smart Gateway Operator and Service Telemetry Operator in the `service-telemetry` namespace on your {OpenShift} environment.

* Upgrade {OpenShift} from v4.8 to v4.10.

* Re-enable the operators that you removed.

* Update the {MessageBus} CA Certificate on {OpenStack}({OpenStackShort}).

.Prerequisites

* You have backed up your data. There is an outage during the {OpenShift} upgrade. You cannot reconfigure the `ServiceTelemetry` and `SmartGateway` objects during the Operators replacement.
* Prepare your environment for upgrade from {OpenShift} v4.8 to the supported version, v4.10.
* The {OpenShift} cluster is fully connected. {ProjectShort} does not support disconnected or restricted-network clusters.
* Remove the  AMQ Certificate Manager before you upgrade {OpenShift}. Verify that no other Operators or workloads require the AMQ Certificate Manager in your environment.
