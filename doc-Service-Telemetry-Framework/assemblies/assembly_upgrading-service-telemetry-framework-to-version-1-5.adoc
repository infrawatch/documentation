= Upgrading {Project} to version 1.5

:context: upgrading-service-telemetry-framework-to-version-1-5

To upgrade {Project} ({ProjectShort}) 1.4 to {ProjectShort} 1.5, you must complete the following steps:

* Replace AMQ Certificate Manager with Certificate Manager.
* Remove the `ClusterServiceVersion` and `Subscription` objects for Smart Gateway Operator and Service Telemetry Operator in the `service-telemetry` namespace on your {OpenShift} environment.

* Upgrade {OpenShift} from 4.8 to 4.10.

* Re-enable the operators that you removed.
ifdef::include_when_13,include_when_17[* Update the {MessageBus} CA Certificate on {OpenStack} ({OpenStackShort}).]

.Prerequisites

* You have backed up your data. There is an outage during the {OpenShift} upgrade. You cannot reconfigure the `ServiceTelemetry` and `SmartGateway` objects during the Operators replacement.
* You have prepared your environment for upgrade from {OpenShift} 4.8 to the supported version, 4.10.
* The {OpenShift} cluster is fully-connected. {ProjectShort} does not support disconnected or restricted-network clusters.
