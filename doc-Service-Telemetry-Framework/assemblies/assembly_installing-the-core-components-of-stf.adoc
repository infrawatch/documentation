[role="_abstract"]
You can use Operators to load the {Project} ({ProjectShort}) components and objects. Operators manage each of the following {ProjectShort} core and community components:

* {MessageBus}
* Smart Gateway
* Prometheus and AlertManager
* Elasticsearch
* Grafana

.Prerequisites

* {OpenShift} 4.8 is running.
* You have prepared your {OpenShift} environment and ensured that there is persistent storage and enough resources to run the {ProjectShort} components on top of the {OpenShift} environment. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/4907241[Service Telemetry Framework Performance and Scaling].
* Your environment is fully connected. {ProjectShort} does not work in a {OpenShift}-disconnected environments or network proxy environments.

ifeval::["{build}" == "downstream"]
[IMPORTANT]
{ProjectShort} is compatible with {OpenShift} 4.10.
