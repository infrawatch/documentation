You can use Operators to load the {Project} ({ProjectShort}) components and objects. Operators manage each of the following {ProjectShort} core and community components:

* {MessageBus}
* Smart Gateway
* Prometheus and AlertManager
* ElasticSearch
* Grafana

.Prerequisites

* An {OpenShift} version inclusive of {SupportedOpenShiftVersion} through {NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion} is running.
* You have prepared your {OpenShift} environment and ensured that there is persistent storage and enough resources to run the {ProjectShort} components on top of the {OpenShift} environment. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/4907241[Service Telemetry Framework Performance and Scaling].


ifeval::["{build}" == "downstream"]
[IMPORTANT]
{ProjectShort} is compatible with {OpenShift} version {SupportedOpenShiftVersion} through {NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}.
