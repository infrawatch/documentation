You can use Operators to load the {Project} ({ProjectShort}) components and objects. Operators manage each of the following {ProjectShort} core and community components:

* cert-manager
* {MessageBus}
* Smart Gateway
* Prometheus and AlertManager
* Grafana

.Prerequisites

ifeval::["{SupportedOpenShiftVersion}" == "{NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}"]
* {OpenShift} version {SupportedOpenShiftVersion} is running.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{SupportedOpenShiftVersion}" != "{NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}"]
* An {OpenShift} version inclusive of {SupportedOpenShiftVersion} through {NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion} is running.
endif::[]
* You have prepared your {OpenShift} environment and ensured that there is persistent storage and enough resources to run the {ProjectShort} components on top of the {OpenShift} environment. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/4907241[Service Telemetry Framework Performance and Scaling].
* Your environment is fully connected. {ProjectShort} does not work in a {OpenShift}-disconnected environments or network proxy environments.

ifeval::["{build}" == "downstream"]
[IMPORTANT]
ifeval::["{SupportedOpenShiftVersion}" == "{NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}"]
{ProjectShort} is compatible with {OpenShift} version {SupportedOpenShiftVersion}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{SupportedOpenShiftVersion}" != "{NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}"]
{ProjectShort} is compatible with {OpenShift} version {SupportedOpenShiftVersion} through {NextSupportedOpenShiftVersion}.
endif::[]
endif::[]
