[role="_abstract"]
You can use Operators to load the various application components and objects. Each of the following {ProjectShort} core components are managed by Operators:

* Prometheus and AlertManager
* ElasticSearch
* Smart Gateway
* {MessageBus}

.Prerequisites

* {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort}) version 4.5 is running.
* You have prepared your {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort}) environment and ensured that there is persistent storage and enough resources to run the {ProjectShort} components on top of the {OpenShiftShort} environment.


ifeval::["{build}" == "downstream"]
[IMPORTANT]
{OpenShift} version 4.5 is currently required for a successful installation of {ProjectShort}. To upgrade to later versions of {ProjectShort}, you must migrate installations of {ProjectShort} 1.0 that use an `OperatorSource` to `CatalogSource`. For more information about migrating, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/5477371[Migrating Service Telemetry Framework v1.0 from OperatorSource to CatalogSource].
