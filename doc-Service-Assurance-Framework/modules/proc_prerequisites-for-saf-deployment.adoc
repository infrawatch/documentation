// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_prerequisites-for-saf-deployment.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Prerequisites for SAF Deployment

Complete the following prerequisite tasks:

. Deploy OCP 3.11 and a bastion node, which executes the supplied bash script to load the components into the `sa-telemetry` namespace. If you already have an OCP 3.11 environment, see <<preparing-your-openshift-environment-for-saf_installing-the-core-components-of-saf>>.

. Install a suitable platform on which to install OCP, for example, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform].

. Install OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/installing_clusters/index[OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 Installing Clusters].
