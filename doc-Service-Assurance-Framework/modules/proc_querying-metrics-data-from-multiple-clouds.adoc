// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_querying-metrics-data-from-multiple-clouds.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Querying metrics data from multiple clouds

Data stored in Prometheus has a "service" label attached according to the
smart gateway it was scraped from. You can use this label to query data from a
specific cloud.

To query data from a specific cloud, use a Prometheus `promql` query that matches the associated "service" label; for example: `sa_collectd_uptime{service="cloud1-smartgateway"}`.
