// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_configuring-saf-for-multi-cloud.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Configuring multiple clouds

To configure multiple OpenStack clouds to target a single instance of {projectshort}, complete the following tasks:

. Plan the AMQP address prefixes to use for each cloud. For more information, see <<planning-amqp-address-prefixes_connecting-multiple-clouds-to-saf>>.
. Deploy metrics and events consumer Smart Gateways for each cloud to listen on
 the corresponding address prefixes. For more information, see <<deploying-smart-gateways_connecting-multiple-clouds-to-saf>>.
. (Optional) Delete the default Smart Gateways if they are no longer needed, see <<deleting-the-default-smart-gateways_connecting-multiple-clouds-to-saf>>.
. Configure each cloud to send its metrics and events to SAF on the
 correct address. For more information, see <<updating-collectd-configuration_connecting-multiple-clouds-to-saf>>.

The following diagram demonstrates how two OpenStack clouds connect to Service Assurance Framework.
