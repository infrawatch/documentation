// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_quickstart-script-for-development-usage.adoc.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Quickstart Script for Development Usage

A script is provided to deploy SAF into an existing OpenShift environment. It
allows for SAF to be started for development purposes, and is not intended for
production environments. It takes care of all of the required steps for a
single-cloud setup. Ensure the following tools are installed before execution:

* Ansible 2.7+
* OpenShift CLI (oc from https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v3.11.0)
* openssl

The script can be found here: https://github.com/redhat-service-assurance/telemetry-framework/blob/master/deploy/quickstart.sh
