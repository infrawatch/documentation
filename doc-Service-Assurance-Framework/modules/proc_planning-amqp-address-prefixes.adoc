// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_planning-amqp-address-prefixes.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Planning AMQP address prefixes

By default, OpenStack nodes are configured to send data to the `collectd/telemetry` and `collectd/notify` addresses on the AMQP bus; and SAF is configured to listen on those addresses for monitoring data. To support multiple clouds and to identify which cloud generated the monitoring data, configure each cloud to send data to a unique address.

It is recommended that you prefix a cloud identifier to the second part of the
address. For example:

* collectd/cloud1-telemetry
* collectd/cloud1-notify
* collectd/cloud2-telemetry
* collectd/cloud2-notify
* collectd/us-east-1-telemetry
* collectd/us-west-3-telemetry
* ...etc
