// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_overview-of-service-assurance-framework.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

Service Assurance Framework (SAF) is an application running on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). Use SAF to collect metrics and record events from the nodes in your systems that you want to monitor. The metrics and event information travels on a message bus to the server side for storage. Use this centralized information as the source for alerts, visualization, or the source of truth for orchestration frameworks.
