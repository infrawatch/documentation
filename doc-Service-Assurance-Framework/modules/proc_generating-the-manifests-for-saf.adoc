// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_generating-the-manifests-for-saf.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Generating the manifests for SAF

Several of the manifests required for deployment are dynamically generated with Ansible.

[NOTE]
====
Ansible version 2.6 or later is recommended.
====

To generate the additional manifests for SAF, ensure that you are logged into the OCP environment within the `sa-telemetry` namespace and run the following command:

----
ansible-playbook \
-e "registry_path=$(oc registry info)" \
-e "imagestream_namespace=$(oc project --short)" \
deploy_builder.yml
----

By default a persistent volume claim (PVC) of 20G is requested for Prometheus. To adjust the default PVC size, insert `-e "prometheus_pvc_storage_request=<size_in_gigabytes>G"` before `deploy_builder.yml` in the command.
