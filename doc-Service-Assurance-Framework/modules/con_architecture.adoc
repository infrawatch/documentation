// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>
:appendix-caption: Appendix
// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_architecture.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

{ProjectShort} uses the following components:

* collectd to collect metrics
* Prometheus as time-series data storage
* ElasticSearch as events data storage
* An AMQP 1.x compatible messaging bus to shuttle the metrics to {ProjectShort} for storage in Prometheus
* Smart Gateway

The following diagram is an overview of {ProjectShort} architecture:

On the client side, collectd collects high-resolution metrics. The data is
delivered to Prometheus using the AMQP1 plugin, which places the data onto the
message bus. On the server side, a Golang application called the Smart Gateway
takes the data stream from the bus and exposes it as a local scrape endpoint
for Prometheus.

Server-side {ProjectShort} monitoring infrastructure consists of the following
layers:

* {Project} 1.x ({ProjectShort})
* {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort})
* Infrastructure platform
