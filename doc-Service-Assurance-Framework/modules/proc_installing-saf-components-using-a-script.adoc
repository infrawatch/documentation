// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_installing-saf-components-using-a-script.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Installing {ProjectShort} components using a script

Before you run the provided script, ensure that you meet the following
prerequisites:

. You are logged into {OpenShiftShort} as an administrator and have the `oc`
tool available in your `$PATH`. The `deploy.sh` script performs a validation to
ensure that this is true. The script switches to the `sa-telemetry` namespace
prior to deploying, and if it cannot find that namespace, the script attempts
to create it.

. You have extracted the contents of the telemetry-framework release archive
and have changed to the extracted directory. For more information, see
<<preparing-your-openshift-environment-for-saf_installing-the-core-components-of-saf>>.

Use the `deploy.sh` script in the `deploy/` directory of the
telemetry-framework release file that you previously extracted. Run the script
with no arguments (or the `CREATE` argument) to start the various components in
your {OpenShiftShort} deployment. To remove the components, supply the `DELETE`
argument to the script.
