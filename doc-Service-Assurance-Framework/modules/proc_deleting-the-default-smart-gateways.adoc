// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_deleting-the-default-smart-gateways.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

Once you have configured SAF for multiple clouds, you may want to delete the
default Smart Gateways if they are no longer in use.

The steps are:

. Delete default Smart Gateways from the cluster.
+
----
oc delete smartgateway cloud1-notify cloud1-telemetry
----
. (Optionally) Delete the default manifests
+
----
rm deploy/service-assurance/smartgateway/{events,metrics}-smartgateway.yaml
----
[NOTE]
The default manifests will be regenerated if you re-run the <<generating-the-manifests-for-saf_installing-the-core-components-of-saf,Generating the manifests for SAF>> step.
