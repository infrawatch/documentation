// This assembly can be included from other assemblies using the following

// include::<path>/assembly_configuring-saf-components.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The following line is necessary to allow assemblies be included in other
// assemblies. It restores the `context` variable to its previous state.
:parent-context-of-configuring-saf-components: {context}

// The file name and the ID are based on the assembly title.
// For example:
// * file name: assembly_my-assembly-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='assembly_my-assembly-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My assembly A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module.
// Avoid changing it after the module has been published
// to ensure existing links are not broken.
//
// In order for  the assembly to be reusable in other assemblies in a guide,
// include {context} in the ID: [id='a-collection-of-modules_{context}'].
//
// If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund
// form, such as Creating or Configuring.

// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID
// includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if
// it is reused multiple times in a guide.

After you install the {Project} ({ProjectShort}) server-side components, you are ready to configure the {ProjectShort} data collection to collect data and store it on the cloud platform side.  You must enable data collection within your {OpenStack} environment and direct it back to {ProjectShort}.  This section describes how to install and configure collectd.
