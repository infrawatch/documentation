// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This assembly can be included from other assemblies using the following
// include statement:
// include::<path>/assembly_configuring-saf-components.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The following line is necessary to allow assemblies be included in other
// assemblies. It restores the `context` variable to its previous state.
:parent-context-of-configuring-saf-components: {context}

// The file name and the ID are based on the assembly title.
// For example:
// * file name: assembly_my-assembly-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='assembly_my-assembly-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My assembly A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module.
// Avoid changing it after the module has been published
// to ensure existing links are not broken.
//
// In order for  the assembly to be reusable in other assemblies in a guide,
// include {context} in the ID: [id='a-collection-of-modules_{context}'].
//
// If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund
// form, such as Creating or Configuring.

// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID
// includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if
// it is reused multiple times in a guide.

After you install the SAF server-side components, you are ready to configure SAF data collection to collect data and store it on the cloud platform side.  You must enable data collection within your OpenStack environment and direct it back to SAF.  This section describes how to install and configure collectd.
