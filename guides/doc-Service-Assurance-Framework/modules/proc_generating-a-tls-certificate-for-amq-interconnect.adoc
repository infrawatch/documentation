// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/proc_generating-a-tls-certificate-for-amq-interconnect.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='proc_doing-procedure-a_{context}']
// * Title: = Doing procedure A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// Start the title with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also
// _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Generating a TLS certificate for AMQ Interconnect

To get the remote QDR connections through the OpenShift route, use TLS/SSL certificates. The following two commands create the appropriate certificate files locally and load the contents into a secret for use by QDR. The QDR on the client side connects to the route address (DNS address) for the QDR service on port 443.

. Generate an unsigned certificate. If you have a signed certificate to load into Red Hat OpenShift, go to the next step.

    openssl req -new -x509 -batch -nodes -days 11000 \
      -subj "/O=io.interconnectedcloud/CN=qdr-white.sa-telemetry.svc.cluster.local" \
      -out /tmp/tls.crt \

. Use the oc command to import the certificate into Red Hat OpenShift:

    oc create secret tls qdr-white-cert \
