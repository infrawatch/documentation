//This file contains the basic undercloud and overcloud commands that we use in our guides.
//Each command has a tag to distinguish it from an undercloud command, overcloud command (admin users),
//or overcloud command (non-admin users).
//To include one of the commands in your module, use the include:: directive and the appropriate tag.
//For example: include::../../common/global/undercloud_overcloud_commands.adoc[tag=overcloud-admin-users]


// tag::undercloud-command[]

. Log in to the undercloud host as the `stack` user.

. Source the `stackrc` undercloud credentials file:
+
----
$ source ~/stackrc
----

// end::undercloud-command[]


// tag::overcloud-admin-users[]

. Source the overcloud credentials file:
+
----
$ source ~/<credentials_file>
----
+
* Replace `<credentials_file>` with the name of your credentials file, for example, `overcloudrc`.

// end::overcloud-admin-users[]

//Tip for writers:When the overcloud command requires an admin role,
//consider adding a prerequisite to your procedure,
//for example, "You must be a RHOSP user with the admin role."


// tag::overcloud-cloud-users[]

. Source your credentials file.

// end::overcloud-cloud-users[]
